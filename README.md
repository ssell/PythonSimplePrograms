# Python Simple Programs

Simple Python 3 Examples

## Overview

A collection of simple sample programs written in Python 3. The programs are a mixture of updated samples from the [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms) and personal inventions.

Each sample is contained within its own Python file. A 'Main' script is also present from which any of the samples may be run from. 

These samples were created in Visual Studio 2015 using [PTSVS 2.2.5](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/releases/tag/v2.2.5post1) and [CPython 3.5.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Note

These samples were written while learning Python 3 for the first time, and therefore may not be representative of ideal code.
